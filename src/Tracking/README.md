# Usage Tracking

_Google for WooCommerce_ implements usage tracking, based on the native [WooCommerce Usage Tracking](https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/), and is only enabled when WooCommerce Tracking is enabled.

When a store opts in to WooCommerce usage tracking and uses _Google for WooCommerce_, they will also be opted in to the tracking added by _Google for WooCommerce_.

## What is tracked

As in WooCommerce core, only non-sensitive data about how a store is set up and managed is tracked. We **do not track or store personal data** from your clients.

* Plugin version
* Settings
  * WordPress.com account connection status
  * Google Merchant center account connection status
